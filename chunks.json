Tariffs vary by sector, with considerations like protecting sensitive sectors from foreign competition and permitting access to important raw materials and intermediate goods. India has ensured that tariff policies comply with WTO rules and regulations. Over time, several efforts have been made to rationalise tariffs further and address the inverted duty structures. 3.14 Tariffs are often perceived to have an impact on competitiveness. However, if used in a calibrated way, tariffs can aid the goals of industrial policy and help in the development of desirable sectors in the economy (Box III.1). 21 WTO data on regional Trade Agreements, https://tinyurl.com/59e3yw6b. 22 Based on the data available on the WTO Integrated Database, https://tao.wto.org/.External Sector85Box III.1: Tariffs and successful industrial policy design Industrial policy refers to measures that target the transformation of an industry in pursuit of a public goal.

    "of Tele-Radiology and AI in silicosis management Silicosis is a debilitating lung disease caused by inhaling silica dust. It is associated with severe comorbidities such as tuberculosis, cancer, ischemic heart disease, bronchitis, and infections from bacteria and fungi. The Rajasthan state government has set a new benchmark in public health management of this disease, which is widespread in the state due to sandstone mining activities.119 The state government is effectively using digital X-rays, tele-radiology, and AI to streamline the diagnosis of Silicosis. The technology was developed by training an AI model on a vast dataset of over-labelled chest X-rays. By leveraging AI technology, the government enabled the automatic detection of the disease, making the diagnostic process faster and more accurate. This technology has significantly improved the identification and treatment of Silicosis patients.
